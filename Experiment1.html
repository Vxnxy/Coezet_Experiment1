<p><strong>Experiment 01: Measurement of battery cell parameters including internal resistance using a battery tester.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p>To measure the cell parameters such as voltage, Current, Capacity, Temperature, SoC vs OCV Curve, Internal Resistance etc., using the battery pack tester.</p>
<p><strong>Equipments Required:</strong></p>
<p>Cell Tester, Impedance Meter</p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<p>To initiate impedance measurements, the probe of the impedance meter should be positioned onto the corresponding terminals of the battery cell as shown in the below figure.</p>

<p>Subsequently, impedance measurements can be initiated within the impedance meter software, ensuring that the desired frequency is selected, as mentioned in the below image.</p>

<p>Once the IR is measured, we can connect the cell in the cell tester and start charging and discharging as per our requirement in the cell tester software.</p>

<p>Using these data of cell parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, we can extract the SoC vs OCV Curve as mentioned below,</p>
<p>SOC for charging= (Current Capacity/Final Capacity) *100</p>
<p>SOC for discharging= 100-(Current Capacity/Final Capacity) *100</p>
